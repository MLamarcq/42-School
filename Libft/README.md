# Libft - 42 Project

Libft is the first project of the 42 cursus common core. The goal of this project is to re-implement several standard C library functions, which can be useful for other projects throughout the cursus. 

This project helps solidify your understanding of C by writing functions related to string manipulation, memory management, and linked lists from scratch.

## Features

- **String Manipulation Functions:**
  - `ft_strlen`: Computes the length of a string.
  - `ft_strdup`: Duplicates a string.
  - `ft_strjoin`: Concatenates two strings.
  
- **Conversion Functions:**
  - `ft_atoi`: Converts a string to an integer.
  - `ft_itoa`: Converts an integer to a string.

- **Memory Management:**
  - `ft_memset`: Fills a memory area with a constant byte.
  - `ft_bzero`: Sets a memory area to zero.
  
- **Linked List Manipulation:**
  - `ft_lstnew`: Creates a new list element.
  - `ft_lstadd_front`: Adds an element at the beginning of a list.

All functions are implemented in the C language, following the C99 standard.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (GCC recommended).
- Make (optional, for easier compilation).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MLamarcq/libft.git
   cd libft
